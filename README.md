# Campus Food Map
Campus Food Map is a small program designed to help students find and share food information around the campus. With the increasing interest of students in food and the rapid development of mobile Internet technology, traditional food recommendation methods have been unable to meet the needs of users, and it is often difficult for students to find nearby food shops. The campus food map mini program came into being, providing students with a convenient and efficient platform to quickly find nearby shops, view detailed information and user reviews, and share their own food experience.
