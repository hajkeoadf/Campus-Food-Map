# Campus Food Map
Campus Food Map is a small program designed to help students find and share food information around the campus. With the increasing interest of students in food and the rapid development of mobile Internet technology, traditional food recommendation methods have been unable to meet the needs of users, and it is often difficult for students to find nearby food shops. The campus food map mini program came into being, providing students with a convenient and efficient platform to quickly find nearby shops, view detailed information and user reviews, and share their own food experience.

## User Needs Analysis

We distributed questionnaires on campus and gathered 302 students to fill them out. According to the survey data, 40.73% of the students expressed a strong desire to have a small program platform dedicated to recording the food around the campus. In addition, the proportion of users willing to try to use our small program reached 78.48%, which is quite considerable, indicating that the vast majority of users have a positive attitude towards our small program and are willing to try to use it. This further validates the popularity of our small program features and design. In addition, the proportion of users with a neutral attitude was 13.58%. These users may have a wait-and-see attitude towards our small program, and we need to win their trust and support through our actual performance. Therefore, we should pay attention to the feedback of this part of users, continue to optimize our small programs, improve the user experience, in order to convert this part of users. Finally, the percentage of users who do not want to use our small program is 7.95%. Although this part of the user account for a relatively small number, but we can not ignore their objections. We should learn more about the reasons for their objection and see if we can solve their problems by improving our applet.
